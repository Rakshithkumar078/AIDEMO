INTRODUCTION  \\nWhoever we may deal with, and wherever we may operate, we are committed to doing so lawfully, \\nethically and with integrity. As part of this commitment, all forms of bribery and corruption are \\nunacceptable and will not be tolerated. We must not, and we must ensure that any third party \\nacting on our behalf does not, act corruptly in our dealings with any other person. \\nThis anti-bribery and corruption policy sets out PearlArc Systems Pvt Ltd policies to prevent acts of \\nbribery and corruption. These policies and procedures have been designed to comply with \\nlegislation governing bribery and corruption on a global basis. \\n \\nThis policy provides guidance on the standards of behaviour to which we must all adhere and most \\nof these reflect the common sense and good business practices that we all work to in any event. \\nThis policy is designed to help you to identify when something is prohibited so that bribery and \\ncorruption is avoided, and provide you with help and guidance if you are unsure about whether \\nthere is a problem and you need further advice. \\nThis policy is applicable to all employees. \\n \\n2. OBJECTIVE \\nPearlArc Systems Private Limited (“PearlArc” or the “Company”) is committed to the prevention, \\ndeterrence and detection of fraud, bribery and all other corrupt business practices. It is PearlArc’ \\ns policy to conduct all of its business activities with honesty, integrity and the highest possible \\nethical standards and vigorously enforce its business practice, wherever it operates throughout \\nthe world, of not engaging in bribery or corruption. \\n \\n3. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY   \\nThis Anti-bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy (this “Policy”) applies to all individuals worldwide \\nworking for all affiliates and subsidiaries of PearlArc at all levels and grades, including directors, \\nsenior executives, officers, employees (whether permanent, fixed-term or temporary), \\nconsultants, interns, or any other person associated with PearlArc (collectively referred to as “You” \\nor “you” in this Policy).     \\n \\nIn this Policy, “Third Party(ies)” means any individual or organization, who / which come into \\ncontact with PearlArc or transact with PearlArc and also includes actual and potential clients, \\nsuppliers, business contacts, consultants, intermediaries, representatives, subcontractors, agents, \\nadvisers, joint ventures and government & public bodies (including their advisers, representatives \\nand officials, politicians and political parties).   \\n \\n4. ABBREVIATION \\n \\nIMSO –Integrated Management System Officer \\n \\n5.

It is the responsibility of each of us to ensure that we comply with \\nthese standards in our daily working lives. This policy sets out a single standard that all employees \\nmust comply with, regardless of whether local law or practices might permit something to the \\ncontrary. \\n \\nPart of PearlArc Systems Pvt Ltd commitment to prevent bribery and corruption is to ensure that \\nthe people acting on our behalf also do so in compliance with effective anti-bribery and corruption \\npolicies. Accordingly, where we engage third parties such as agents, distributors or joint venture \\npartners, we have obligations to complete sufficient due diligence when entering into \\narrangements to ensure that they are not acting corruptly, and to periodically monitor their \\nperformance to ensure ongoing compliance. In short, if we can’t do it, neither can they. \\n \\n \\n6. HOW TO RAISE A CONCERN   \\nEvery person, to whom this policy applies too, is encouraged to raise their concerns about any \\nbribery issue or suspicion of malpractice at the earliest possible stage. If he/ she is unsure whether \\na particular act constitutes bribery or corruption or if he / she has any other queries, these should \\nbe raised with their respective Manager and/or the Management.  \\n \\n7. WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE A VICTIM OF BRIBERY AND \\nCORRUPTION?   \\nIt is his / her responsibility to inform / report it to their respective Managers and the Management \\nas soon as possible if you are offered a bribe by a third party, you are asked to make one, suspect \\nthat this may happen in the future or believe that you are a victim of another form of corruption \\nor other unlawful activity. You must refuse to accept or make the payment from or to a third party, \\nexplain our policy against accepting or making such payment and make it clear that the refusal is \\nfinal and non-negotiable because of this Policy. If you encounter any difficulty making this refusal, \\nyou should seek assistance from your Manager.  \\n \\n8. PROTECTION   \\nThose who refuse to accept or offer a bribe or those who raise concerns or report another’s \\nwrongdoing, are sometimes worried about possible repercussions. We encourage openness and \\nwill support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this Policy, even if they turn \\nout to be mistaken. We are committed to ensuring that no one suffers any detrimental \\ntreatment as a result of refusing to take part in bribery or corrupt activities or because of \\nreporting their suspicion in good faith that an actual or potential bribery or other corruption \\noffence has taken place or may take place in the future. If any employee believes that he / she \\nhas suffered any such treatment, he / she should inform their Manager/Management \\nimmediately.'),\n",

The overarching framework of engagement with non-State actors and \\nthe WHO policy and operational procedures on management of engagement \\nwith non-State actors apply to all engagements with non-State actors at all \\nlevels of the Organization, 2  whereas the four specific policies and \\noperational procedures on engagement are limited in application to, \\nrespectively, nongovernmental organizations, private sector entities, \\nphilanthropic foundations and academic institutions. \\nENGAGEMENT: RATIONALE, PRINCIPLES, BENEFITS AND RISKS \\nRationale \\n2. WHO is the directing and coordinating authority in global health in line \\nwith its constitutional mandate. The global health landscape has become \\nmore complex in many respects; among other things, there has been an \\nincrease in the number of players including non-State actors. WHO engages \\nwith non-State actors in view of their significant role in global health for the \\nadvancement and promotion of public health and to encourage non-State \\nactors to use their own activities to protect and promote public health. \\n3. The functions of WHO, as set out in Article 2 of its Constitution, include: \\nto act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health \\nwork; to establish and maintain effective collaboration with diverse \\norganizations; and to promote cooperation among scientific and \\nprofessional groups which contribute to the advancement of health. The \\nConstitution further mandates the Health Assembly or the Executive Board, \\nand the Director-General, to enter into specific engagements with other \\norganizations. 3  WHO shall, in relation to non-State actors, act in \\nconformity with its Constitution and resolutions and decisions of the Health \\nAssembly, and bearing in mind those of the United Nations General \\n_________ \\n1 See resolution WHA69.10 (2016). \\n2 Headquarters, regional offices and country offices, entities established under WHO, as well as hosted \\npartnerships. For hosted partnerships the Framework of Engagement with Non-State Actors will apply, \\nsubject to the policy on WHO’s engagement with global health partnerships and hosting arrangements \\n(resolution WHA63.10). Hosted, as well as external partnerships are explained in paragraph 49. \\n3 WHO Constitution, Articles 18, 33, 41 and 71.'),\n",

WHO’s engagement with non-State actors supports implementation of \\nthe Organization’s policies and recommendations as decided by the \\ngoverning bodies, as well as the application of WHO’s technical norms and \\nstandards. Such an effective engagement with non-State actors at global, \\nregional and country levels, also calls for due diligence and transparency \\nmeasures applicable to non-State actors under this framework. In order to \\nbe able to strengthen its engagement with non-State actors for the benefit \\nand interest of global public health, WHO needs simultaneously to \\nstrengthen its management of the associated potential risks. This requires a \\nrobust framework that enables engagement and serves also as an instrument \\nto identify the risks, balancing them against the expected benefits, while \\nprotecting and preserving WHO’s integrity, reputation and public health \\nmandate. \\nPrinciples \\n5. WHO’s engagement with non-State actors is guided by the following \\noverarching principles. \\n \\nAny engagement must: \\n(a) demonstrate a clear benefit to public health; \\n(b) conform with WHO’s Constitution, mandate and General \\nProgramme of Work  \\n(c) respect \\nthe \\nintergovernmental \\nnature \\nof \\nWHO \\nand \\nthe \\ndecision-making authority of Member States as set out in the WHO’s \\nConstitution; \\n(d) support and enhance, without compromising, the scientific and \\nevidence-based approach that underpins WHO’s work; \\n(e) protect WHO from any undue influence, in particular on the \\nprocesses in setting and applying policies, norms and standards;1 \\n(f) not compromise WHO’s integrity, independence, credibility and \\nreputation; \\n(g) be effectively managed, including by, where possible avoiding \\nconflict of interest2 and other forms of risks to WHO; \\n_________ \\n1 Policies, norms and standard setting includes information gathering, preparation for, elaboration of \\nand the decision on the normative text. \\n2 As set out in paragraphs 22–26.'),\n",

WHO’s engagement with non-State actors can bring important benefits \\nto global public health and to the Organization itself in fulfilment of its \\nconstitutional principles and objectives, including its directing and \\ncoordinating role in global health. Engagements range from major, \\nlonger-term collaborations to smaller, briefer interactions. Benefits arising \\nfrom such engagement can also include: \\n(a) the contribution of non-State actors to the work of WHO  \\n(b) the influence that WHO can have on non-State actors to enhance \\ntheir impact on global public health or to influence the social, economic \\nand environmental determinants of health \\n(c) the influence that WHO can have on non-State actors’ compliance \\nwith WHO’s policies, norms and standards \\n(d) the additional resources non-State actors can contribute to WHO’s \\nwork \\n(e) the wider dissemination of and adherence by non-State actors to \\nWHO’s policies, norms and standards \\nRisks of engagement \\n7.

For \\nthe \\npurpose \\nof \\nthis \\nframework, \\nnon-State \\nactors \\nare \\nnongovernmental organizations, private sector entities, philanthropic \\nfoundations and academic institutions. \\n9. Nongovernmental organizations are non-profit entities that operate \\nindependently of governments. They are usually membership-based, with \\nnon-profit entities or individuals as members exercising voting rights in \\nrelation to the policies of the nongovernmental organization, or are \\notherwise constituted with non-profit, public-interest goals. They are free \\nfrom concerns which are primarily of a private, commercial or \\nprofit-making nature. They could include, for example, grassroots \\ncommunity organizations, civil society groups and networks, faith-based \\norganizations, professional groups, disease-specific groups, and patient \\ngroups. \\n10. Private sector entities are commercial enterprises, that is to say \\nbusinesses that are intended to make a profit for their owners. The term also \\nrefers to entities that represent, or are governed or controlled by, private \\nsector entities. This group includes (but is not limited to) business \\nassociations representing commercial enterprises, entities not “at arm’s \\nlength”2 from their commercial sponsors, and partially or fully State-owned \\ncommercial enterprises acting like private sector entities. \\nInternational business associations are private sector entities that do not \\nintend to make a profit for themselves but represent the interests of their \\nmembers, which are commercial enterprises and/or national or other \\nbusiness associations. For the purposes of this framework, they shall have \\nthe authority to speak for their members through their authorized \\nrepresentatives. Their members shall exercise voting rights in relation to the \\npolicies of the international business association. \\n_________ \\n1 Endorsement does not include established processes such as prequalifications or the WHO Pesticide \\nEvaluation Scheme (WHOPES). \\n2 An entity is “at arm’s length” from another entity if it is independent from the other entity, does not \\ntake instructions and is clearly not influenced or clearly not reasonably perceived to be influenced in its \\ndecisions and work by the other entity.'),\n",

Philanthropic foundations are non-profit entities whose assets are \\nprovided by donors and whose income is spent on socially useful purposes. \\nThey shall be clearly independent from any private sector entity in their \\ngovernance and decision-making. \\n12. Academic institutions are entities engaged in the pursuit and \\ndissemination of knowledge through research, education and training.1 \\n13. For each of the four groups of entities above, the overarching framework \\nand the respective specific policy on engagement apply. WHO will \\ndetermine through its due diligence if a non-State actor is subject to the \\ninfluence of private sector entities to the extent that the non-State actor has \\nto be considered itself a private sector entity. Such influence can be exerted \\nthrough financing, participation in decision making or otherwise. Provided \\nthat the decision-making processes and bodies of a non-State actor remain \\nindependent of undue influence from the private sector, WHO can decide to \\nconsider the entity as a nongovernmental organization, a philanthropic \\nfoundation or an academic institution, but may apply relevant provisions of \\nthe WHO’s policy and operational procedures on engagement with private \\nsector entities, such as not accepting financial and in-kind contributions for \\nuse in the normative work. \\nTYPES OF INTERACTION \\n14. The following are categories of interaction in which WHO engages with \\nnon-State actors. Each type of interaction can take different forms, be \\nsubject to different levels of risk and can involve different levels and types \\nof engagement by the Organization. \\nParticipation \\n15. Non-State actors may attend various types of meetings organized by \\nWHO. The nature of their participation depends on the type of meeting \\nconcerned. The format, modalities, and the participation of non-State actors \\nin consultations, hearings, and other meetings is decided on a case-by-case \\nbasis by the WHO governing bodies or by the Secretariat. \\n(a) Meetings of the governing bodies. This type involves sessions of \\nthe World Health Assembly, the Executive Board and the six regional \\ncommittees. Non-State actors’ participation is determined by the \\ngoverning bodies’ respective rules of procedure, policies and practices \\nas well as the section of this framework that deals with official relations. \\n_________ \\n1 This can include think tanks which are policy-oriented institutions, as long as they primarily perform \\nresearch; international associations of academic institutions are considered as nongovernmental \\norganizations, subject to paragraph 13.'),\n",

An institutional conflict of interest is a situation\\nwhere WHO’s primary interest as reflected in its Constitution may be\\nunduly influenced by the conflicting interest of a non-State actor in a way\\nthat affects, or may reasonably be perceived to affect, the independence and\\nobjectivity of WHO’s work.\\n25.

For WHO, the potential risk of institutional conflicts of interest could be \\nthe highest in situations where the interest of non-State actors, in particular \\neconomic, commercial or financial, are in conflict with WHO’s public \\nhealth policies, constitutional mandate and interests, in particular the \\nOrganization’s independence and impartiality in setting policies, norms and \\nstandards. \\nDue diligence and risk assessment \\n27. When the possibility of entering into an engagement is being considered, \\nthe relevant technical unit in the Secretariat conducts an initial examination \\nin order to establish whether such an engagement would be in the interest \\nof the Organization and in line with the principles of WHO’s engagement \\nwith non-State actors in paragraph 5 and the priorities defined in the General \\nProgramme of Work and Programme budget. If this seems to be the case, \\nthe technical unit consults the WHO Register on non-State actors and as \\nneeded asks the non-State actor to provide its basic information. Using the \\nOrganization-wide electronic tool, the unit then complements this \\ninformation with a description of the proposed engagement and its own \\nassessment of the benefits and risks involved, as needed. \\n28. The technical unit makes an initial assessment. If the engagement is of \\nlow risk, for example because of its repetitive nature1 or because it does not \\ninvolve policies, norms and standard setting, a simplified due diligence and \\nrisk assessment modulating the procedures in paragraphs 29–36 as well as \\n39 can be performed by the technical unit and the risk management decision \\ntaken, taking such steps as are necessary to ensure full compliance with \\nparagraphs 5–7.2 For all other engagements full procedures apply. \\n29. Before engaging with any non-State actor, WHO, in order to preserve \\nits integrity, conducts due diligence and risk assessment. Due diligence \\nrefers to the steps taken by WHO to find and verify relevant information on \\na non-State actor and to reach a clear understanding of its profile. While due \\ndiligence refers to the nature of the non-State actor concerned, risk \\nassessment refers to the assessment of a specific proposed engagement with \\nthat non-State actor. \\n_________ \\n1 Provided that due diligence and risk assessment have already been carried out and the nature of \\nengagement has remained unchanged. \\n2 The simplified due diligence and risk assessment, and information to be provided by non-State actors \\nas well as the criteria of low risk engagements are described in the guide for staff.'),\n",

Due diligence combines a review of the information provided by the \\nnon-State actor, a search for information about the entity concerned from \\nother sources, and an analysis of all the information obtained. This includes \\na screening of different public, legal and commercial sources of information, \\nincluding: media; the entity’s website companies’ analyst reports, \\ndirectories and profiles; and public, legal and governmental sources. \\n31. The core functions of due diligence are to: \\n• clarify the nature and purpose of the entity proposed to engage with \\nWHO; \\n• clarify the interest and objectives of the entity in engaging with WHO \\nand what it expects in return; \\n• determine the entity’s legal status, area of activities, membership, \\ngovernance, sources of funding, constitution, statutes, and by-laws \\nand affiliation; \\n• define the main elements of the history and activities of the entity in \\nterms of the following: health, human and labour issues; \\nenvironmental, ethical and business issues; reputation and image; and \\nfinancial stability; \\n• identify if paragraph 44 or 45 should be applied. \\n32. Due diligence also allows the Secretariat for the purpose of its \\nengagement to categorize each non-State actor in relation to one of the four \\ngroups of non-State actors on the basis of its nature, objectives, governance, \\nfunding, independence and membership. This categorization is indicated in \\nthe register of non-State actors. \\n33. Risks are the expression of the likelihood and potential impact of an \\nevent that would affect the Organization’s ability to achieve its objectives. \\nA risk assessment on a proposed engagement is conducted in addition to \\ndue diligence.

DEFINITIONS \\n1.1 An expert advisory panel consists of experts from whom the \\nOrganization may obtain technical guidance and support within a particular \\nsubject, either by correspondence or at meetings to which the experts may \\nbe invited. \\n1.2 A member of an expert advisory panel is an expert appointed by the \\nDirector-General who undertakes to contribute by correspondence technical \\ninformation on developments in his or her field, and to offer advice as \\nappropriate, spontaneously or upon request. \\n1.3 An expert committee is a group of expert advisory panel members \\nconvened by the Director-General for the purpose of reviewing and making \\ntechnical recommendations on a subject of interest to the Organization. \\n_________ \\n1 Text adopted by the Thirty-fifth World Health Assembly (resolution WHA35.10), in replacement of \\nthe regulations adopted by the Fourth World Health Assembly.

It may, for example, relate to the manner in which the debate is conducted, to the \\nmaintenance of order, to the observance of the Rules of Procedure, or to the way in which presiding \\nofficers exercise the powers conferred upon them by the Rules. Under a point of order, a delegate or \\na representative of an Associate Member may request the presiding officer to apply a certain Rule of \\nProcedure or he or she may question the way in which the officer applies the Rule. Thus, within the \\nscope of the Rules of Procedure, delegates or representatives are enabled to direct the attention of the \\npresiding officer to violations or misapplications of the Rules by other delegates or representatives \\nor by the presiding officer herself or himself. A point of order has precedence over any other matter, \\nincluding procedural motions (Rules 56 and 62). \\n(b) Points of order raised under Rule 56 involve questions necessitating a ruling by the presiding \\nofficer, subject to possible appeal. They are therefore distinct from the procedural motions provided \\nfor in Rules 59 to 62, which can be decided only by a vote and on which more than one motion may \\nbe entertained at the same time, Rule 62 laying down the precedence of such motions. They are also \\ndistinct from requests for information or clarification, or from remarks relating to material \\narrangements (seating, interpretation system, temperature of the room), documents, translations, etc., \\nwhich – while they may have to be dealt with by the presiding officer – do not require rulings from \\nher or him. However, in established practice, a delegate or a representative of an Associate Member \\nintending to submit a procedural motion or to seek information or clarification often rises to “a point \\nof order” as a means of obtaining the floor. The latter usage, which is based on practical grounds, \\nshould not be confused with the raising of points of order under Rule 56. \\n(c) Under Rule 56, a point of order must be immediately decided by the presiding officer in \\naccordance with the Rules of Procedure; any appeal arising therefrom must also be put immediately \\nto the vote. It follows that, as a general rule: \\n(i) \\nneither a point of order, nor any appeal arising from a ruling thereon, is debatable; \\n(ii) \\nno point of order on the same or a different subject can be permitted until the initial point \\nof order and any appeal arising therefrom have been disposed of.'),\n",

In addition, the presiding officer may, if he or she considers it necessary, \\nrequest an expression of views from delegations on a point of order before giving her or his ruling; \\nin the exceptional cases in which this practice is resorted to, the presiding officer should terminate \\nthe exchange of views and give her or his ruling as soon as he or she is ready to announce that ruling. \\n(d) Rule 56 provides that a delegate or a representative of an Associate Member rising to a point of \\norder may not speak on the substance of the matter under discussion.

However, any breach of this policy will be taken seriously and may \\nresult in disciplinary action. \\n \\n5. STATUS OF THE POLICY \\nThis policy has been approved by the Board of Directors of PearlArc. It sets out our rules on data \\nprotection and the legal conditions that must be satisfied in relation to the obtaining, handling, \\nprocessing, storage, transportation and destruction of personal information. \\n \\n6. DEFINITION OF DATA PROTECTION TERMS  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nData is information which is stored electronically, on a computer, or in certain paper-\\nbased filing systems. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nData subjects for the purpose of this policy include all living individuals about whom we \\nhold personal data. All data subjects have legal rights in relation to their personal data. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nPersonal data means data relating to a living individual who can be identified from that \\ndata (or from that data and other information in our possession). Personal data can be \\nfactual (such as a name, address or date of birth) or it can be an opinion (such as a \\nperformance appraisal). \\n\\uf0b7 \\nData Controllers are the people who or organizations which determine the purposes for \\nwhich, and the manner in which, any personal data is processed. They have a \\nresponsibility to establish practices and policies in line with the Act. PearlArc is the Data \\nController of all personal data used in its business and in that of its subsidiary companies. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nData users include employees whose work involves using personal data. Data users have \\na duty to protect the information they handle by following our data protection and \\nsecurity policies at all times. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nData processors include any person who processes personal data on behalf of a Data \\nController. Employees of Data Controllers are excluded from this definition but it could \\ninclude suppliers which handle personal data on our behalf. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nProcessing is any activity that involves use of the data. It includes obtaining, recording or \\nholding the data, or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the data including \\norganizing, amending, retrieving, using, disclosing, erasing or destroying it. Processing \\nalso includes transferring personal data to third parties. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSensitive personal data includes information about a person's racial or ethnic origin, \\npolitical opinions, religious or similar beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental \\nhealth or condition or sexual life, or about the commission of, or proceedings for, any \\noffence committed or alleged to have been committed by that person, the disposal of \\nsuch proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings. Sensitive personal \\ndata can only be processed under strict conditions, and will usually require the express \\nconsent of the person concerned. \\n \\n7. DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES \\nAnyone processing personal data must comply with the eight enforceable principles of good \\npractice. These provide that personal data must be: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nProcessed fairly and lawfully. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nProcessed for limited purposes and in an appropriate way. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAdequate, relevant and not excessive for the purpose. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAccurate.\"),\n",

FAIR AND LAWFUL PROCESSING  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe Act is intended not to prevent the processing of personal data, but to ensure that it \\nis done fairly and without adversely affecting the rights of the data subject. The data \\nsubject must be told who the Data Controller is; who the Data Controller's representative \\nis (in this case the Company Secretary; the purpose for which the data is to be processed \\nby us, and the identities of anyone to whom the data may be disclosed or transferred. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nFor personal data to be processed lawfully, certain conditions have to be met. These may \\ninclude, among other things, requirements that the data subject has consented to the \\nprocessing, or that the processing is necessary for the legitimate interest of the Data \\nController or the party to whom the data is disclosed. When sensitive personal data is \\nbeing processed, more than one condition must be met. In most cases the data subject's \\nexplicit consent to the processing of such data will be required. \\n \\n9. PROCESSING FOR LIMITED PURPOSES  \\nPersonal data may only be processed for the specific purposes notified to the data subject when \\nthe data was first collected or for any other purposes specifically permitted by the Act. This \\nmeans that personal data must not be collected for one purpose and then used for another. If it \\nbecomes necessary to change the purpose for which the data is processed, the data subject must \\nbe informed of the new purpose before any processing occurs. \\n \\n10. ADEQUATE, RELEVANT AND NON-EXCESSIVE PROCESSING \\nPersonal data should only be collected to the extent that it is required for the specific purpose \\nnotified to the data subject. Any data which is not necessary for that purpose should not be \\ncollected in the first place. \\n \\n11. ACCURATE DATA \\nPersonal data must be accurate and kept up to date. Information which is incorrect or misleading \\nis not accurate and steps should therefore be taken to check the accuracy of any personal data at \\nthe point of collection and at regular intervals afterwards. Inaccurate or out-of-date data should \\nbe destroyed. \\n \\n12. TIMELY PROCESSING \\nPersonal data should not be kept longer than is necessary for the purpose. This means that data \\nshould be destroyed or erased from our systems when it is no longer required. For guidance on \\nhow long certain data is likely to be kept before being destroyed, contact the Company \\nSecretary. \\n \\n13. PROCESSING IN LINE WITH DATA SUBJECTS RIGHTS  \\nData must be processed in line with data subjects' rights. Data subjects have a right to: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nRequest access to any data held about them by a Data Controller.\"),\n",

Data subjects may apply to the courts for compensation if they have \\nsuffered damage from such a loss. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe Act requires us to put in place procedures and technologies to maintain the security \\nof all personal data from the point of collection to the point of destruction. Personal data \\nmay only be transferred to a third-party data processor if he agrees to comply with those \\nprocedures and policies, or if he puts in place adequate measures himself. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nMaintaining data security means guaranteeing the confidentiality, integrity and \\navailability of the personal data, defined as follows: \\n\\uf076 Confidentiality means that only people who are authorized to use the data can \\naccess it. \\n\\uf076 Integrity means that personal data should be accurate and suitable for the \\npurpose for which it is processed. \\n\\uf076 Availability means that authorized users should be able to access the data if they \\nneed it for authorized purposes.

SECURITY PROCEDURES INCLUDE \\n\\uf0b7 \\nEntry controls. Any stranger seen in entry-controlled areas should be reported. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSecure lockable desks and cupboards.

DEALING WITH SUBJECT ACCESS REQUESTS \\nA formal request from a data subject for information that we hold about them must be made in \\nwriting. A fee is payable by the data subject for provision of this information. Any member of \\nstaff who receives a written request should forward it to [their line manager OR the Data \\nProtection Compliance Manager] immediately. \\n \\n17. PROVIDING INFORMATION OVER THE TELEPHONING \\nAny member of staff dealing with telephone enquiries should be careful about disclosing any \\npersonal information held by us. In particular they should: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nCheck the caller's identity to make sure that information is only given to a person who is \\nentitled to it. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSuggest that the caller put their request in writing if they are not sure about the caller's \\nidentity and where their identity cannot be checked. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nRefer to [their line manager OR the Data Protection Compliance Manager] for assistance \\nin difficult situations.

INTRODUCTION \\nPearlArc Systems Private Limited recognises that it is essential to provide equal opportunities to \\nall persons without discrimination. This policy sets out the company's position on equal \\nopportunity in all aspects of employment, including recruitment, promotion and provides guidance \\nand encouragement to employees at all levels to act fairly and prevent discrimination on the \\ngrounds of sex, race, marital status, disability as defined by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, \\npart-time and fixed term contract status, age, sexual orientation or religion. \\n2. DEFINITION OF DISCRIMINATION \\nDiscrimination can be direct or indirect. Both forms of discrimination must be avoided.  \\nDirect discrimination occurs when one person is treated less favourably than another on grounds \\nrelating to sex, race, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation or religion. \\n3. STATEMENT OF POLICY \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIt is the policy of PearlArc Systems Private Limited to ensure that no job applicant or \\nemployee receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of sex, race, marital status, \\ndisability, age, part-time or fixed term contract status, sexual orientation or religion, or is \\ndisadvantaged by conditions or requirements that cannot be shown to be justifiable. The \\norganisation is committed not only to its legal obligations but also to the positive \\npromotion of equality of opportunity in all aspects of employment. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe organisation recognises that adhering to the Equal Opportunities Policy, combined \\nwith relevant employment policies and practices, maximises the effective use of \\nindividuals in both the organisation's and employees' best interests. PearlArc Systems \\nPrivate Limited recognises the great benefits in having a diverse workforce with different \\nbackgrounds, solely employed on ability.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe application of recruitment, training, and promotion policies to all individuals will be \\non the basis of job requirements and the individual's ability and merits. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAll employees of the organisation will be made aware of the provisions of this policy. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nPearlArc prohibits employment of person below the age of 18 years. \\n4.

It is the responsibility of each of us to ensure that we comply with \\nthese standards in our daily working lives. This policy sets out a single standard that all employees \\nmust comply with, regardless of whether local law or practices might permit something to the \\ncontrary. \\n \\nPart of PearlArc Systems Pvt Ltd commitment to prevent bribery and corru ption is to ensure that \\nthe people acting on our behalf also do so in compliance with effective anti-bribery and corruption \\npolicies. Accordingly, where we engage third parties such as agents, distributors or joint venture \\npartners, we have obligations to complete sufficient due diligence when entering into \\narrangements to ensure that they are not acting corruptly, and to periodically monitor their \\nperformance to ensure ongoing compliance. In short, if we can’t do it, neither can they.  \\n \\n6. HOW TO RAISE A CONCERN   \\nEvery person, to whom this policy applies too, is encouraged to raise their concerns about any \\nbribery issue or suspicion of malpractice at the earliest possible stage. If he/ she is unsure whether \\na particular act constitutes bribery or corruption or if he / she has any other queries, these should \\nbe raised with their respective Manager and/or the Management.  \\n \\n7. WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE A VICTIM OF BRIBERY AND \\nCORRUPTION?   \\nIt is his / her responsibility to inform / report it to their respective Managers and the Management \\nas soon as possible if you are offered a bribe by a third party, you are asked to make one, suspect \\nthat this may happen in the future or believe that you are a victim of another form of corruption \\nor other unlawful activity. You must refuse to accept or make the payment from or to a third party, \\nexplain our policy against accepting or making such payment and make it clear that the refusal is \\nfinal and non-negotiable because of this Policy. If you encounter any difficulty making this refusal, \\nyou should seek assistance from your Manager.  \\n \\n8. PROTECTION   \\nThose who refuse to accept or offer a bribe or those who raise concerns or report another’s \\nwrongdoing, are sometimes worried about possible repercussions. We encourage openness and \\nwill support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this Policy, even if they turn \\nout to be mistaken. We are committed to ensuring that no one suffers any detrimental \\ntreatment as a result of refusing to take part in bribery or corrupt activities or because of \\nreporting their suspicion in good faith that an actual or potential bribery or other corruption \\noffence has taken place or may take place in the future. If any employee believes that he / she \\nhas suffered any such treatment, he / she should inform their Manager/Management \\nimmediately.'),\n",

The overarching framework of engagement with non -State actors and \\nthe WHO policy and operational procedures on management of engagement \\nwith non-State actors apply to all engagements with non -State actors at all \\nlevels of the Organization, 2  whereas the four specific policies and \\noperational procedures on engagement are limited in application to, \\nrespectively, nongovernmental organizations , private sector entities, \\nphilanthropic foundations and academic institutions. \\nENGAGEMENT: RATIONALE, PRINCIPLES, BENEFITS AND RISKS \\nRationale \\n2. WHO is the directing and coordinating authority in global health in line \\nwith its constitutional mandate. The global health landscape has become \\nmore complex in many respects; among other things, there has been an \\nincrease in the number of players including non-State actors. WHO engages \\nwith non-State actors in view of their significant role in global health for the \\nadvancement and promotion of public health and to encourage non -State \\nactors to use their own activities to protect and promote public health. \\n3. The functions of WHO, as set out in Article 2 of its Constitution, include: \\nto act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health \\nwork; to establish and maintain effective collaboration with diverse \\norganizations; and to promote cooperation among scientific and \\nprofessional groups which contribute to the advancem ent of health. The \\nConstitution further mandates the Health Assembly or the Executive Board, \\nand the Director -General, to enter into specific engagements with other \\norganizations. 3  WHO shall, in relation to non -State actors, act in \\nconformity with its Constitution and resolutions and decisions of the Health \\nAssembly, and bearing in mind those of the United Nations General \\n_________ \\n1 See resolution WHA69.10 (2016). \\n2 Headquarters, regional offices and country offices, entities established under WHO, as well as hosted \\npartnerships.

Such an effective engagement with non -State actors at global, \\nregional and cou ntry levels, also calls for due diligence and transparency \\nmeasures applicable to non -State actors under this framework. In order to \\nbe able to strengthen its engagement with non -State actors for the benefit \\nand interest of global public health, WHO needs simultaneously to \\nstrengthen its management of the associated potential risks. This requires a \\nrobust framework that enables engagement and serves also as an instrument \\nto identify the risks, balancing them against the expected benefits, while \\nprotecting a nd preserving WHO’s integrity, reputation and public health \\nmandate. \\nPrinciples \\n5. WHO’s engagement with non -State actors is guided by the following \\noverarching principles. \\n Any engagement must: \\n(a) demonstrate a clear benefit to public health; \\n(b) conform with WHO’s Constitution, mandate and General \\nProgramme of Work  \\n(c) respect the intergovernmental nature of WHO and the \\ndecision-making authority of Member States as set out in the WHO’s \\nConstitution; \\n(d) support and enhance, without compromising, the sci entific and \\nevidence-based approach that underpins WHO’s work; \\n(e) protect WHO from any undue influence, in particular on the \\nprocesses in setting and applying policies, norms and standards;1 \\n(f) not compromise WHO’s integrity, independence, credibility and \\nreputation; \\n(g) be effectively managed, including by, where possible avoiding \\nconflict of interest2 and other forms of risks to WHO; \\n_________ \\n1 Policies, norms and standard setting includes information gathering, preparation for, elaboration of \\nand the decision on the normative text. \\n2 As set out in paragraphs 22–26.'),\n",

WHO’s engagement with non-State actors can bring important benefits \\nto global public health and to the Organization itself in fulfilment of its \\nconstitutional principles and objectives, including its directing and \\ncoordinating role in global health. Engagements range from major, \\nlonger-term collaborations to smaller, briefer interactions. Benefits arising \\nfrom such engagement can also include: \\n(a) the contribution of non-State actors to the work of WHO  \\n(b) the influence that WHO can have on non -State actors to enhance \\ntheir impact on global public health or to influence the social, economic \\nand environmental determinants of health \\n(c) the influence that WHO can ha ve on non -State actors’ compliance \\nwith WHO’s policies, norms and standards \\n(d) the additional resources non-State actors can contribute to WHO’s \\nwork \\n(e) the wider dissemination of and adherence by non -State actors to \\nWHO’s policies, norms and standards \\nRisks of engagement \\n7.

For the purpose of this framework, non -State actors are \\nnongovernmental organizations, private sector entities, philanthropic \\nfoundations and academic institutions. \\n9. Nongovernmental organizations  are non -profit entities that operate \\nindependently of governments. They are usually membership -based, with \\nnon-profit entities or individuals as members exercising voting rights in \\nrelation to the policies of the nongovernmental organization, or are \\notherwise constituted with non -profit, public -interest goals. They are free \\nfrom concerns which are primarily of a private, commercial o r \\nprofit-making nature. They could include, for example, grassroots \\ncommunity organizations, civil society groups and networks, faith -based \\norganizations, professional groups, disease -specific groups, and patient \\ngroups. \\n10. Private sector  entities are com mercial enterprises, that is to say \\nbusinesses that are intended to make a profit for their owners. The term also \\nrefers to entities that represent, or are governed or controlled by, private \\nsector entities. This group includes (but is not limited to) busi ness \\nassociations representing commercial enterprises, entities not “at arm’s \\nlength”2 from their commercial sponsors, and partially or fully State-owned \\ncommercial enterprises acting like private sector entities. \\nInternational business associations are private sector entities that do not \\nintend to make a profit for themselves but represent the interests of their \\nmembers, which are commercial enterprises  and/or national or other \\nbusiness associations. For the purposes of this framework, t hey shall have \\nthe authority to speak for their members through their authorized \\nrepresentatives. Their members shall exercise voting rights in relation to the \\npolicies of the international business association. \\n_________ \\n1 Endorsement does not include established processes such as prequalifications or the WHO Pesticide \\nEvaluation Scheme (WHOPES). \\n2 An entity is “at arm’s length” from another entity if it is independent from the other entity, does not \\ntake instructions and is clearly not influenced or clearly not reasonably perceived to be influenced in its \\ndecisions and work by the other entity.'),\n",

Philanthropic foundations  are non -profit entities whose assets are \\nprovided by donors and whose income is spent on socially useful purposes. \\nThey shall be clearly independent from any private sector entity in their \\ngovernance and decision-making. \\n12. Academic institutions  are enti ties engaged in the pursuit and \\ndissemination of knowledge through research, education and training. 1 \\n13. For each of the four groups of entities above, the overarching framework \\nand the respective specific policy on engagement apply. WHO will \\ndetermine th rough its due diligence if a non -State actor is subject to the \\ninfluence of private sector entities to the extent that the non -State actor has \\nto be considered itself a private sector entity. Such influence can be exerted \\nthrough financing, participation in decision making or otherwise. Provided \\nthat the decision-making processes and bodies of a non -State actor remain \\nindependent of undue influence from the private sector, WHO can decide to \\nconsider the entity as a nongovernmental organization, a philanthro pic \\nfoundation or an academic institution, but may apply relevant provisions of \\nthe WHO’s policy and operational procedures on engagement with private \\nsector entities, such as not accepting financial and in-kind contributions for \\nuse in the normative work. \\nTYPES OF INTERACTION \\n14. The following are categories of interaction in which WHO engages with \\nnon-State actors. Each type of interaction can take different forms, be \\nsubject to different levels of risk and can involve different levels and types \\nof engagement by the Organization. \\nParticipation \\n15. Non-State actors may attend various types of meetings organized by \\nWHO. The nature of their participation depends on the type of meeting \\nconcerned. The format, modalities, and the participation of non-State actors \\nin consultations, hearings, and other meetings is decided on a case -by-case \\nbasis by the WHO governing bodies or by the Secretariat. \\n(a) Meetings of the governing bodies . This type involves sessions of \\nthe World Health Assembly, the Executive Board and t he six regional \\ncommittees. Non -State actors’ participation is determined by the \\ngoverning bodies’ respective rules of procedure, policies and practices \\nas well as the section of this framework that deals with official relations. \\n_________ \\n1 This can include think tanks which are policy-oriented institutions, as long as they primarily perform \\nresearch; international associations of academic institutions are considered as nongovernmental \\norganizations, subject to paragraph 13.'),\n",

A conflict of interest arises in circumstances where there is potential for\\na secondary interest (a vested  interest in the outcome of WHO’s work in a\\ngiven area) to unduly influence, or where it may be reasonably perceived to\\nunduly influence, either the independence or objectivity of professional\\njudgement or actions regarding a primary interest (WHO’s work) The\\nexistence of conflict of interest in all its forms does not as such mean that\\nimproper action has occurred, but rather the risk of such improper action\\noccurring.

For WHO, the potential risk of institutional conflicts of interest could be \\nthe highest in situations where the interest of non-State actors, in particular \\neconomic, commercial or financial, are in conflict with WHO’s public \\nhealth policies, constitutional mandate and interests, in particular the \\nOrganization’s independence and impartiality in setting policies, norms and \\nstandards. \\nDue diligence and risk assessment \\n27. When the possibility of entering into an engagement is being considered, \\nthe relevant technical unit in the Secretariat conducts an initial examination \\nin order to establish whether such an engagement would be in the interest \\nof the Organization and in line with the principles of WHO’s engagement \\nwith non-State actors in paragraph 5 and the priorities defined in the General \\nProgramme of Work and Programme budget. If this seems to be the case, \\nthe technical unit consults the WHO Register on non -State actors and as \\nneeded asks the non-State actor to provide its basic i nformation. Using the \\nOrganization-wide electronic tool, the unit then complements this \\ninformation with a description of the proposed engagement and its own \\nassessment of the benefits and risks involved, as needed. \\n28. The technical unit makes an initial assessment. If the engagement is of \\nlow risk, for example because of its repetitive nature1 or because it does not \\ninvolve policies, norms and standard setting, a simplified due diligence and \\nrisk assessment modulating the procedures in paragraphs 29 –36 as well as \\n39 can be performed by the technical unit and the risk management decision \\ntaken, taking such steps as are necessary to ensure full compliance with \\nparagraphs 5–7.2 For all other engagements full procedures apply. \\n29. Before engaging with any non -State actor, WHO, in order to preserve \\nits integrity, conducts due diligence and risk asses sment. Due diligence  \\nrefers to the steps taken by WHO to find and verify relevant information on \\na non-State actor and to reach a clear understanding of its profile. While due \\ndiligence refers to the nature of the non -State actor concerned, risk \\nassessment refers to the assessment of a specific proposed engagement with \\nthat non-State actor. \\n_________ \\n1 Provided that due diligence and risk assessment have already been carried out and the nature of \\nengagement has remained unchanged. \\n2 The simplified due diligence and risk assessment, and information to be provided by non-State actors \\nas well as the criteria of low risk engagements are described in the guide for staff.'),\n",

Due diligence combines a review of the information provided by the \\nnon-State actor, a search for information about the entity concerned from \\nother sources, and an analysis of all the information obtained. This includes \\na screening of different public, legal and commercial sources of information, \\nincluding: media; the entity’s website companies’ analyst reports, \\ndirectories and profiles; and public, legal and governmental sources. \\n31. The core functions of due diligence are to: \\n• clarify the nature and purpose of the entity proposed to engage with \\nWHO; \\n• clarify the interest and objectives of the entity in engaging with WHO \\nand what it expects in return; \\n• determine the entit y’s legal status, area of activities, membership, \\ngovernance, sources of funding, constitution, statutes, and by -laws \\nand affiliation; \\n• define the main elements of the history and activities of the entity in \\nterms of the following: health, human and labour issues; \\nenvironmental, ethical and business issues; reputation and image; and \\nfinancial stability; \\n• identify if paragraph 44 or 45 should be applied. \\n32. Due diligence also allows the Secretariat for the purpose of its \\nengagement to categorize each non-State actor in relation to one of the four \\ngroups of non-State actors on the basis of its nature, objectives, governance, \\nfunding, independence and membership. This categorization is indicated in \\nthe register of non-State actors. \\n33. Risks are the expression o f the likelihood and potential impact of an \\nevent that would affect the Organization’s ability to achieve its objectives. \\nA risk assessment on a proposed engagement is conducted in addition to \\ndue diligence. This involves the assessment of risks associated  with an \\nengagement with a non -State actor, in particular the risks described in \\nparagraph 7 and is to be conducted without prejudice to the type of non-State \\nactor. \\nRisk management \\n34. Risk management  concerns the process leading to a management \\ndecision whereby the Secretariat  decides explicitly and justifiably on entry \\ninto engagement,1 continuation of engagement, engagement with measures \\n_________ \\n1 Other than decisions related to official relations as set out in paragraphs 50 –57.'),\n",

Therefore the \\nFramework of Engagement with Non -State Actors applies to their \\nengagement with non -State actors. They have a formal governance \\nstructure, separate from that of the WHO governing bodies, in which \\ndecisions are taken on direction, workplans and budgets; and their \\nprogrammatic accountability frameworks are also independent from \\nthose of the Organization. In the same way the framework applies to \\nother hosted entities which are subject to the Organizations Rules \\nand Regulations. \\n(ii) WHO’s involvement in external partnerships is regulated by the \\npolicy on WHO’s engagement with global health partnerships and \\n_________ \\n1 See http://www.who.int/about/licensing/emblem/en/. \\n2 Basic documents, 48th ed.

This policy regulates specifically WHO’s engagement with academic \\ninstitutions by type of interaction. 1  The pr ovisions of the overarching \\nframework also apply to all engagements with academic institutions. \\n2. The engagement with academic institutions at the institutional level has \\nto be distinguished from the collaboration with individual experts working \\nfor academic institutions. \\nPARTICIPATION \\nParticipation by academic institutions in WHO meetings \\n3. WHO can invite academic institutions to participate in consultations, \\nhearings or other meetings in accordance with paragraph 15 of the \\noverarching framework. Consultations and hearings can be electronic or in \\nperson. \\n4. Participation in other meetings is on the basis of discussion of an item \\nin which the academic institution has a particular interest and where its \\nparticipation adds value to the deli berations of the meeting. Such \\nparticipation is for the exchange of information and views, but never for the \\nformulation of advice. \\n5. The nature of participation of academic institution depends on the type \\nof meeting concerned. The format, modalities, and  the participation of \\nacademic institution in consultations, hearings, and other meetings is \\ndecided on a case -by-case basis by the WHO governing bodies or by the \\nSecretariat. Participation and inputs received from academic institutions \\nshall be made publicly available, wherever possible. Academic institutions \\ndo not take part in any decision-making process of the Organization. \\nInvolvement of the Secretariat in meetings organized by academic \\ninstitutions \\n6. WHO can organize joint meetings, or cosponsor meetings organized by \\nacademic institutions, as long as the integrity, independence and reputation \\nof the Organization are preserved, and as long as this participation furthers \\nWHO’s objectives as expressed in the General Programme of Work. WHO \\nstaff members m ay participate in meetings organized by academic \\ninstitutions in accordance with the Organization’s internal rules.

Before voting begins, the President shall hand to the tellers appointed by her or him the list of \\nMembers entitled to vote and the list of candidates.

The Secretariat shall distribute a ballot paper to each delegation. Every ballot paper shall be of \\nthe same size and colour without distinguishing marks. \\n3. The tellers shall satisfy themselves that the ballot box or ballot boxes is/are empty and, having \\nlocked it/them, shall hand the key/keys to the President. \\n4. Except as otherwise determined by the Health Assembly, Members shall be called in turn to vote \\nin the required alphabetical order of their names,1 beginning with the name of a Member which shall \\nhave been drawn by lot. The call shall be made in English, French, Russian and Spanish.\\n5. The secretary of the meeting and the tellers shall record each Member’s vote by marking the \\nmargin of the list of Members entitled to vote opposite to the name of the Member in question.\\n6. At the conclusion of the calling of Members, the President shall ensure that all the  Members \\npresent and entitled to vote have been called. He or she shall then declare the voting closed and \\nannounce that the votes are to be counted. \\n7. When the ballot box or ballot boxes has/have been opened, the tellers shall count the number of \\nballot papers. If the number is not equal to that of the voters, the President shall declare the vote \\ninvalid and another ballot shall be held. \\n8. Where the counting of votes takes place outside the Assembly Hall, the ballot papers shall be \\nreturned to the ballot box w hich shall be taken by the tellers to the room where the votes are to be \\ncounted. \\n9. One of the tellers shall then read aloud the names which are on the ballot paper. The number of \\nvotes obtained by each of the candidates mentioned shall be written opposite their names by one of \\nthe other tellers on a document drawn up for this purpose. \\n10. A ballot paper on which no names are written or which bears the word “abstention” shall be \\nconsidered as signifying an abstention. \\n11. The following shall be considered null and void: \\n(a) ballot papers on which there are more or fewer names than there are elective places to be \\nfilled or on which the name of any candidate appears more than once; \\n(b) ballot papers in which the voters have revealed their identity, in particular by appo sing \\ntheir signature or mentioning the name of the Member they represent; \\n(c) where the Rules of Procedure so require, ballot papers bearing the names of candidates \\nother than those nominated in accordance with the provisions of those Rules.\\n12. When the counting of the votes is completed, the tellers shall indicate the results in a document \\ndrawn up for this purpose, which they shall sign and hand to the President. The latter, in plenary \\nmeeting, shall announce the results in the following order: number of Mem bers entitled to vote; \\nnumber absent; number of abstentions; number of ballot papers null and void; number of Members \\npresent and voting; number required for a majority; names of candidates and the number of votes \\nsecured by each of them, in descending order of the number of votes. \\n_________ \\n1 Under Rule 74 of the Rules of Procedure of the World Health Assembly.'),\n",

For the purposes of these provisions, the following definitions shall apply: \\n(a) “Absent” – Members entitled to vote but whose representatives are not present at the \\nmeeting at which the secret ballot takes place; \\n(b) “Number of Members present and voting” – the difference between the number of \\nMembers with the right to vote and the total number of absentees, abstentions and invalid ballot \\npapers. \\n14. The President shall declare elected candidates who have obtained the required majority. \\n15. The list signed by the tellers and on which the results of the vote have been recorded shall \\nconstitute the official record of the count of the ballot and shall be retained in the Organization’s files. \\nThe ballot papers shall be destroyed immediately after the declaration of the results of the ballot. \\nDescription of the Concept of a Point of Order \\n(a) A point of order is basically an intervention directed to the presiding officer, requesting her or \\nhim to make use of some power inherent in his office or specifically given her or him under the Rules \\nof Procedure. It may, for example, relate to the manner in which the debate is conducted, to the \\nmaintenance of order, to the observance of the Rules of Procedure, or to the way in which presiding \\nofficers exercise the powers conferred upon them by the Rules. Under a point of order, a delegate or \\na representative of an Associate Member may request the presiding officer to apply a certain Rule of \\nProcedure or he or she may question the way in which the officer applies the Rule. Thus, within the \\nscope of the Rules of Procedure, delegates or representatives are enabled to direct the attention of the \\npresiding officer to violations or misapplications of the Rules by other delegates or representatives \\nor by the presiding officer herself or himself. A point of order has precedence over any other matter, \\nincluding procedural motions (Rules 56 and 62). \\n(b) Points of order raised under Rule 56 involve questions necessitating a ruling by the presiding \\nofficer, subject to possible appeal. They are therefore distinct from the procedural motions provided \\nfor in Rules 59 to 62, which can be decided only by a vote and on which more than one motion may \\nbe entertained at the same time, Rule 62 laying down the precedence of such motions. They are also \\ndistinct from requests for information or clarification, or from remarks relating to material \\narrangements (seating, interpretation system, temperature of the room), documents, translations, etc., \\nwhich – while they may have to be dealt with by the presiding officer – do not require rulings from \\nher or him. However, in established practice, a delegate or a representative of an Associate Member \\nintending to submit a procedural motion or to seek information or clarification often rises to “a point \\nof order” as a means of obtaining the floor. The latter usage, which is based on practical grounds, \\nshould not be confused with the raising of points of order under Rule 56. \\n(c) Under Rule 56, a point of order must be immediately decided by the presiding officer in \\naccordance with the Rules of Procedure; any appeal arising therefrom must also be put immediately \\nto the vote. It follows that, as a general rule: \\n(i) neither a point of order, nor any appeal arising from a ruling thereon, is debatable; \\n(ii) no point of order on the same or a different subject can be permitted until the initial point \\nof order and any appeal arising therefrom have been disposed of.'),\n",

In addition, the presiding officer may, if he or she considers it necessary, \\nrequest an expression of views from delegations on a point of order before giving her or his ruling; \\nin the exceptional cases in which this practice is resorted to, the presiding officer should terminate \\nthe exchange of views and give her or his ruling as soon as he or she is ready to announce that ruling. \\n(d) Rule 56 provides that a delegate or a representative of an Associate Member rising to a point of \\norder may not speak on the substance of the matter under discussion. Consequently, the purely \\nprocedural nature of points of order calls for brevity. The presiding officer is responsible for ensuring \\nthat statements made on a point of order are in conformity with the present description.\\n––––––––––'),\n",

However, any breach of this policy will be taken seriously and may \\nresult in disciplinary action. \\n \\n5. STATUS OF THE POLICY \\nThis policy has been approved by the Board of Directors of PearlArc. It sets out our rules on data \\nprotection and the legal conditions that must be satisfied in relation to the obtaining, handling, \\nprocessing, storage, transportation and destruction of personal information. \\n \\n6. DEFINITION OF DATA PROTECTION TERMS  \\n\\uf0b7 Data is information which is stored electronically, on a computer, or in certain paper-\\nbased filing systems. \\n\\uf0b7 Data subjects for the purpose of this policy include all living individuals about whom we \\nhold personal data. All data subjects have legal rights in relation to their personal data. \\n\\uf0b7 Personal data means data relating to a living individual who can be identified from that \\ndata (or from that data and other information in our possession). Personal data can be \\nfactual (such as a name, address or date of birth) or it can be an opinion (such as a \\nperformance appraisal). \\n\\uf0b7 Data Controllers are the people who or organizations which determine the purposes for \\nwhich, and the manner in which, any personal data is processed. They have a \\nresponsibility to establish practices and policies in line with the Act. PearlArc is the Data \\nController of all personal data used in its business and in that of its subsidiary companies. \\n\\uf0b7 Data users include employees whose work involves using personal data. Data users have \\na duty to protect the information they handle by following our data protection and \\nsecurity policies at all times. \\n\\uf0b7 Data processors include any person who processes personal data on behalf of a Data \\nController. Employees of Data Controllers are excluded from this definition but it could \\ninclude suppliers which handle personal data on our behalf. \\n\\uf0b7 Processing is any activity that involves use of the data. It includes obtaining, recording or \\nholding the data, or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the data including \\norganizing, amending, retrieving, using, disclosing, erasing or destroying it. Processing \\nalso includes transferring personal data to third parties. \\n\\uf0b7 Sensitive personal data includes information about a person's racial or ethnic origin, \\npolitical opinions, religious or similar beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental \\nhealth or condition or sexual life, or about the commission of, or proceedings for, any \\noffence committed or alleged to have been committed by that person, the disposal of \\nsuch proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings. Sensitive personal \\ndata can only be processed under strict conditions, and will usually require the express \\nconsent of the person concerned. \\n \\n7. DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES \\nAnyone processing personal data must comply with the eight enforceable principles of good \\npractice. These provide that personal data must be: \\n\\uf0b7 Processed fairly and lawfully. \\n\\uf0b7 Processed for limited purposes and in an appropriate way. \\n\\uf0b7 Adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purpose. \\n\\uf0b7 Accurate.\"),\n",

FAIR AND LAWFUL PROCESSING  \\n\\uf0b7 The Act is intended not to prevent the processing of personal data, but to ensure that it \\nis done fairly and without adversely affecting the rights of the data subject. The data \\nsubject must be told who the Data Controller is; who the Data Controller's representative \\nis (in this case the Company Secretary; the purpose for which the data is to be processed \\nby us, and the identities of anyone to whom the data may be disclosed or transferred. \\n\\uf0b7 For personal data to be processed lawfully, certain conditions have to be met. These may \\ninclude, among other things, requirements that the data subject has consented to the \\nprocessing, or that the processing is necessary for the legitimate interest of the Data \\nController or the party to whom the data is disclosed. When sensitive personal data is \\nbeing processed, more than one condition must be met. In most cases the data subject's \\nexplicit consent to the processing of such data will be required. \\n \\n9. PROCESSING FOR LIMITED PURPOSES  \\nPersonal data may only be processed for the specific purposes notified to the data subject when \\nthe data was first collected or for any other purposes specifically permitted by the Act. This \\nmeans that personal data must not be collected for one purpose and then used for another. If it \\nbecomes necessary to change the purpose for which the data is processed, the data subject must \\nbe informed of the new purpose before any processing occurs. \\n \\n10. ADEQUATE, RELEVANT AND NON-EXCESSIVE PROCESSING \\nPersonal data should only be collected to the extent that it is required for the specific purpose \\nnotified to the data subject. Any data which is not necessary for that purpose should not be \\ncollected in the first place. \\n \\n11. ACCURATE DATA \\nPersonal data must be accurate and kept up to date. Information which is incorrect or misleading \\nis not accurate and steps should therefore be taken to check the accuracy of any personal data at \\nthe point of collection and at regular intervals afterwards. Inaccurate or out-of-date data should \\nbe destroyed. \\n \\n12. TIMELY PROCESSING \\nPersonal data should not be kept longer than is necessary for the purpose. This means that data \\nshould be destroyed or erased from our systems when it is no longer required. For guidance on \\nhow long certain data is likely to be kept before being destroyed, contact the Company \\nSecretary. \\n \\n13. PROCESSING IN LINE WITH DATA SUBJECTS RIGHTS  \\nData must be processed in line with data subjects' rights. Data subjects have a right to: \\n\\uf0b7 Request access to any data held about them by a Data Controller.\"),\n",

Personal data \\nmay only be transferred to a third-party data processor if he agrees to comply with those \\nprocedures and policies, or if he puts in place adequate measures himself. \\n\\uf0b7 Maintaining data security means guaranteeing the confidentiality, integrity and \\navailability of the personal data, defined as follows: \\n\\uf076 Confidentiality means that only people who are authorized to use the data can \\naccess it. \\n\\uf076 Integrity means that personal data should be accurate and suitable for the \\npurpose for which it is processed. \\n\\uf076 Availability means that authorized users should be able to access the data if they \\nneed it for authorized purposes. Personal data should therefore be stored on our \\ncentral computer system instead of individual PCs. \\n\\uf076 Quality means an aspect of availability and thus the capacity of information, \\ndata, applications, IT systems and IT networks in the event of malfunction, \\nfailure or heavy use. \\n \\n15. SECURITY PROCEDURES INCLUDE \\n\\uf0b7 Entry controls. Any stranger seen in entry-controlled areas should be reported. \\n\\uf0b7 Secure lockable desks and cupboards.
